## About 
A binary tree is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The nodes are connected by edges, which represent the relationships between them.

A binary tree can be empty, in which case it contains no nodes. Otherwise, it consists of a root node and two sub-trees, which are themselves binary trees. The left sub-tree contains nodes that are less than the root node, and the right sub-tree contains nodes that are greater than or equal to the root node.

Binary trees are commonly used in computer science to implement binary search algorithms, as well as in the representation of expression trees, Huffman coding trees, and other types of data structures. They can also be used to represent hierarchical data, such as file systems and organizational charts.

Some common operations that can be performed on binary trees include inserting nodes, deleting nodes, searching for a node with a given key, traversing the tree to visit its nodes in a particular order, and balancing the tree to ensure that it remains reasonably well-balanced and efficient.
